The storyboard of the presentation :

I create my microserver "/kabooum" that works correctly on my machine.
It even works properly on my local docker instance.

But when I put it to production into a docker orchestrator (kubernetes/openshift/swarm...) it does not works any more.

First, I notice that for production purpose, it has been limites to 512M, so I add a -Xmx, but it still crash.

- Why is that ?

- because jvm does not that cgroup into account.

- docker use linux kernel, if you do not use "cgroups" layer you access the host


(it is experimental in openjdk-9)

it has been backport into jdk-8

Let seen how it works...
